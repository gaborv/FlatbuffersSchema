# Flatbuffers Schema colorizer for Visual Studio Code
This simple language support module aim to provide syntax highlighting to Flatbuffers schema definition files. 
You can read more about the Flatbuffers schema descriptions at https://google.github.io/flatbuffers/flatbuffers_guide_writing_schema.html

## Acknowledgements
I used the grammar file from [Tobias Kahlert's Flatbuffers plugin for Atom] (https://github.com/SrTobi/language-flatbuffers) and converted it to JSON to use it here.
